# CTRprediction
CTR prediction evaluation of ML classifiers and NNs methods

The following code repository contains a series of Jupyter Notebooks with the following sections:
1. Data API connection: Connect to data sources and run code to store data in local directory
2. Data Pipeline: Defines a pipeline to transform and pre-process dat for modeling
3. Class Imbalance: Investigates class imbalance effects on a randomly initialized RF classifer
4. Regularization: PCA, feature importance Pearson correlation analysis, Lasso regression
5. Models: ML classifiers and NNs methods CTR predictions
